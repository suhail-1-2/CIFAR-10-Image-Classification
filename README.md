CIFAR-10 Image Classification: Comparing ANN and CNN Models
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the comparison between Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebook explores the differences in architecture, training, and performance between these two types of neural networks.

Project Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset used in machine learning and computer vision research. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate both ANN and CNN models to classify these images accurately.

Key Components
Data Preprocessing:

The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including normalization and one-hot encoding of labels.
The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.
Building and Training the ANN Model:

The ANN model is constructed with multiple fully connected (dense) layers.
Activation functions such as ReLU and Softmax are used to introduce non-linearity and predict class probabilities, respectively.
The model is compiled using categorical cross-entropy loss and an optimizer like Adam.
Training is conducted over several epochs, and the model's accuracy and loss are tracked.
Building and Training the CNN Model:

The CNN model is constructed using convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Convolutional layers help capture spatial hierarchies in images, making CNNs more effective for image classification tasks.
Similar to the ANN model, the CNN is compiled and trained, with accuracy and loss monitored.
Model Evaluation:

Both models are evaluated on the test set, and metrics such as accuracy and loss are compared.
The results highlight the performance differences between ANN and CNN, demonstrating why CNNs are generally preferred for image data.
Visualization:

The notebook includes visualizations of test images along with their predicted labels, providing a clear view of how well the models are performing.
A confusion matrix or classification report may be added to further analyze the model's predictions.
Results and Conclusion
Performance Comparison: The CNN model outperforms the ANN model in terms of accuracy and loss on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showcasing the advantage of using convolutional layers for image classification tasks.
Insights: The project provides insights into the strengths of CNNs, particularly their ability to capture local features in images through convolutions and pooling operations.
